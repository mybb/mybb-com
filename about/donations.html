			Without the generous donations from some of MyBB's users, there would be no MyBB. The total cost of servers, domain names, and security audits can climb to thousands of dollars per year. Even the smallest donation can help keep MyBB alive and healthy. Support MyBB today by donating!</p>

			Keeping the MyBB project running is not a small task. While we're committed to providing the most powerful and <strong>free</strong> forum software, it takes a lot to make it all happen. Your donation will go towards all of MyBB's various expenses, such as server costs, domain names, security audits, and other miscellaneous expenses involved in the upkeep of MyBB. <strong>No</strong> donations are ever pocketed for personal use, whatsoever. If there are ever any leftover donations, they are saved for future expenses, such as the next month's server costs.</p>
